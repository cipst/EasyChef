    <h3>Puerto Escondido: Sun, Surf, and Sand</h3>
    <p>Puerto Escondido is known for one of the world's best surfing beaches, Playa Zicatela.
        It has a beautiful yellow sand beach and huge world-class surfin waves (but he careful if you go swimming...the
        current is <em>very strong!</em>).</p>

    <h3>Tikal: Mayan Ruins in the Guatemalan Jungle</h3>
    <p>Tikal is the largest of the ancient ruined cities of the Mayan civilization. It is a really awesome, magical
        place. If you go to Tikal, you have three main lodging options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="listItemTerm">Tikal National Park</span>: Fancier hotels.</li>
        <li><span class="listItemTerm">El Remate</span> (&#126;30km away): Hotels or hostels.</li>
        <li><span class="listItemTerm">Flores</span> (&#126;50km away): Hotels or hostels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Drunk in Dublin</h3>
    <p>Throwin' back pints with the locals in Dublin this past summer made me really appreciate the pub culture. The top
        three bars in Dublin for good <q>craic</q> (i.e. good fun) in order of my preference are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Davy Byrne's</li>
        <li>Kehoe's</li>
        <li>Long Hall</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The price of a pint of beer is about &euro;5. Although I would recommend the cider (around &euro;8 a pint)</p>
